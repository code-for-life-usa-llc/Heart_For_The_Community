        <h2> Sexual Assault </h2>
        <p> Sexaul assault is a very bad thing that is known around the world because of how serious it 
            is. One it could happen to anyone, doesn't matter the race, sex, or age. This is a very bad thing 
            beacsue it doesn't matter that the predator gets arrested because nothing is gonna fix what they damaged.
            The victim will never be emotionally and physically the same. That's why I'm doing this so I can help spread 
            awareness to stop this and help people get help if they are getting sexually assaulted. Help them 
            speak up because sometimes their aggressors threaten the victim to not talk about it.  </p>
