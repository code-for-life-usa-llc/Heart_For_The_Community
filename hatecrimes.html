    <h2> Hate Crimes Against Minorities </h2>
    <p> Nowadays, you would expect that everybody is treated equally. Sadly, that's not the case. 
        Many minorities today like people of color and LGBT members are being targeted especially. </p>

        <h2> Why It's A Problem </h2>
    </div>
    <p> Hate crimes against minorities is becoming a huge problem and it's becoming so common it doesn't
        even seem like a problem anymore. Especially now due to the pandemic, people of color like black
     people and asians are being beaten up, killed, and mocked for something they can't change. Recently,
     a spa full of asians in Atlanta was attacked by a white man and all that the authorities said was 
     that he had a bad day. If a person of color did that, they would be called so many horrible things.
     LGBT memebers are also very mistreated, being called homophobic slurs and being hate crimed just for 
     being themselves. While laws are being made to protect minorities, that doesn't stop people from being
     hateful. </p>

    <h2> How To Help </h2>
    </div>
    <p> While it might seem like there isn't much you can do, there are ways to help! You can sign petitions,
     go to peaceful protests, or post about it on social media. It may seem like this will do nothing, but
     these actions can help bring awareness to others. Hate crimes will never be completely over, but they
     can be decreased. </p>
